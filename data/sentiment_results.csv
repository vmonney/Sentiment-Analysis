You could do so much worse, like the one on La Cienega, these places are owned by different people and it shows. The staff is friendly too. They actually are open 24/7, and my order was dee-lish.

Damn you, Murphy!","our morning started out right: it was bright and early, and i was well-rested and hungry.  like, i need food now.  13 hours of power-walking around disneyland the day before does this to a person!so we got on the road and found a great restaurant on yelp. hundreds of reviews and very high rating. and when we were a block away, my husband turned the car around and decided to go to mcdonalds. really? that's what he wanted on his 30th bday?!!what he really wanted was a fast meal so that we could see the sites we wanted to and then make the drive back up to the bay area. so mcdonalds it was.  drive-thru was fast - oddly, a woman stood out front and she took our order. only strange because the car behind us ordered at the usual screen thing. no matter.  i tried the all egg-white mcmuffin (no additional charge for the all-white substitution). this was new to me. just as good as the mcmuffin i've always enjoyed. but healthier, i guess. not that i'm dining at mcd's because i'm all that health conscious.$12.28 for our breakfast, which we enjoyed while getting the car washed at the best car wash i've ever been to (expert car wash) just up the street. there are just under 100 mcdonald's in los angeles, if you happen to find yourself at this one, i hope your experience is as good as our was. ps - as fate would have it, a summer storm struck later on the drive home. and it rained all over the clean car on top of the grapevine. damn you, murphy!",our morning started out right it was bright and early and i was wellrested and hungry  like i need food now  13 hours of powerwalking around disneyland the day before does this to a personso we got on the road and found a great restaurant on yelp hundreds of reviews and very high rating and when we were a block away my husband turned the car around and decided to go to mcdonalds really thats what he wanted on his 30th bdaywhat he really wanted was a fast meal so that we could see the sites we wanted to and then make the drive back up to the bay area so mcdonalds it was  drivethru was fast  oddly a woman stood out front and she took our order only strange because the car behind us ordered at the usual screen thing no matter  i tried the all eggwhite mcmuffin no additional charge for the allwhite substitution this was new to me just as good as the mcmuffin ive always enjoyed but healthier i guess not that im dining at mcds because im all that health conscious1228 for our breakfast which we enjoyed while getting the car washed at the best car wash ive ever been to expert car wash just up the street there are just under 100 mcdonalds in los angeles if you happen to find yourself at this one i hope your experience is as good as our was ps  as fate would have it a summer storm struck later on the drive home and it rained all over the clean car on top of the grapevine damn you murphy,morning started right bright early wellrested hungry like need food 13 hours powerwalking around disneyland day personso got road found great restaurant yelp hundreds reviews high rating block away husband turned car around decided go mcdonalds really thats wanted 30th bdaywhat really wanted fast meal could see sites wanted make drive back bay area mcdonalds drivethru fast oddly woman stood front took order strange car behind us ordered usual screen thing matter tried eggwhite mcmuffin additional charge allwhite substitution new good mcmuffin ive always enjoyed healthier guess im dining mcds im health conscious1228 breakfast enjoyed getting car washed best car wash ive ever expert car wash street 100 mcdonalds los angeles happen find one hope experience good ps fate would summer storm struck later drive home rained clean car top grapevine damn murphy,morning started right bright early wellrested hungry like need food 13 hours powerwalking around disneyland day personso got road found great restaurant yelp hundreds reviews high rating block away husband turned car around decided mcdonalds really thats wanted 30th bdaywhat really wanted fast meal could see sites wanted make drive back bay area mcdonalds drivethru fast oddly woman stood front took order strange car behind us ordered usual screen thing matter tried eggwhite mcmuffin additional charge allwhite substitution new good mcmuffin ive always enjoyed healthier guess dining mcds health conscious1228 breakfast enjoyed getting car washed best car wash ive ever expert car wash street 100 mcdonalds los angeles happen find hope experience good ps fate would summer storm struck later drive home rained clean car top grapevine damn murphy,morning started right bright early wellrested hungry like need food 13 hour powerwalking around disneyland day personso got road found great restaurant yelp hundred review high rating block away husband turned car around decided mcdonalds really thats wanted 30th bdaywhat really wanted fast meal could see site wanted make drive back bay area mcdonalds drivethru fast oddly woman stood front took order strange car behind u ordered usual screen thing matter tried eggwhite mcmuffin additional charge allwhite substitution new good mcmuffin ive always enjoyed healthier guess dining mcds health conscious1228 breakfast enjoyed getting car washed best car wash ive ever expert car wash street 100 mcdonalds los angeles happen find hope experience good p fate would summer storm struck later drive home rained clean car top grapevine damn murphy,0.2774816487859967,0.45348955392433654
